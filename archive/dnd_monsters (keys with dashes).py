Its powerful claws and mandibles can easily tear through armor, flesh and bone alike, and its acid spray causes burns and other harm to anyone it reaches. It is voracious in its appetite, consuming anything it can sink its claws into. Its legendary appetite has caused it to come into conflict with many different peoples, its ability to quickly burrow into dirt and clay often complicating matters.",
        "Background": "Ankhegs are thought to be the offspring of the legendary 'Urdkar', a primordial god of the earth and shape-shifting who purportedly created the species as a tool of destruction. Through unknown means, Ankhegs found their way into the world and reproduced. Acting in famished hordes, the Ankhegs terrorized many lands until they were driven back into their dens by powerful adventurers. Though not impossible to kill, they remain difficult to locate and approach, as they are often subterranean creatures. Since ancient times, Ankhegs have held a terrifying reputation.",
        "History": "The origins of anklegs are unclear. Legends suggest that they were created by an ancient being known as Urdkar to cause destruction. This being disappeared suddenly, leaving the anklegs to spread throughout the lands. Over time, the anklegs, while still feared, have become a common nuisance, attacking travelers and villages in search of their next meal.",
        "Lore": "Ankhegs are large, insectoid creatures that typically make their homes in dark, damp places. Those who have encountered them describe them as large, centipede-like creatures with powerful legs and a set of devastating mandibles and claws.

        "Environmental Factors": "Ankhegs are drawn to locations with abundant prey, and are usually found in lairs that are close to where they hunt. They are most comfortable in dark areas with a large amount of moisture, as this allows them to quickly burrow and avoid detection from predators. They are also drawn to darker areas, as they are nocturnal creatures and prefer sleeping during daylight hours.",
        "Habits": "Ankhegs predominately hunt alone, however, when hunting in groups, they are extremely fast and can quickly overwhelm smaller prey.

        "Behavior": "Ankhegs are generally solitary creatures. They rarely hunt together, but when they do, they are extremely fast and can quickly out maneuvers those they attack. They use their powerful mandibles and claws to tear through armor and flesh. They also use their acid-spitting organ to cause additional harm to their prey before they consume it.",

        "Narrative": "Baboons are large primates that inhabit much of the African continent and have the distinction of possessing the widest geographical distribution of any species in the monkey family.

Even today, many African cultures venerate baboons as a symbol of fertility, luck, and protection.",

Over time, however, their origin was revealed to be much more sinister, as rumors began to surface of a multi-eyed race from the Far Realms that sought to conquer the Material Plane. Beholders are now widely accepted as both natural and extra-planar creatures that hunger for power and domination.",

        "Description": "Black puddings are large, amorphous masses of dark ooze that lurk in the depths of subterranean tunnels and caverns. They appear as a viscous, dark-colored liquid that oozes slowly across the ground, leaving a slimy, glistening trail in its wake.",
        "Narrative": "Deep beneath the city lies a winding network of tunnels and caverns that provide safe haven for many of the cave-dwelling creatures of the realm. It's been said a great darkness dwells in the depths of these dank corridors, an ever-growing pool of black ooze that slowly grows in size, winding its way through the hidden gullies of the city. This feared beast is known as the black pudding, a foe that many adventurers have gone up against- and very few have returned still standing.",

        "History": "The first known sighting of the black pudding occurred in Durnady in the year 697. The creature then proceeded to terrorize the city over the next decade, gradually spreading its influence further and further across the continent.

        "Description": "Deer are small ungulates in the family Capreoleae. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors, although they most commonly have light-brown fur and long, elegant legs.",
        "Narrative": "Deer are common, docile creatures in the wild. They graze on grass and other greens, and are hunted by some predators. They are gentle, kind-hearted animals, whose curiosity often more often leads them into trouble than away from it. Although they can be spooked by loud noises or sudden movements, deer are fearless in the face of danger and will fight back if provoked.",
        "Background": "Deer have been around for millennia and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are one of the main keystone species in balancing the environment, with their droppings enriching the local flora and greatly aiding in the Circle of Life. The presence or absence of deer in an area can have a marked impact on the environment, with their grazing helping to maintain a delicate balance of resources.",
        "History": "The history of deer is both long and varied. They have been hunted for millennia both for their meat, and for their skins. In the past, the horns of certain species were also highly sought after and used to make instruments. In more modern times, deer remain an important species in hunting, though many hunting regulations have been enacted to protect the species.",
        "Lore": "In some cultures, deer are considered to be sacred animals. In cultures such as the Lakota, they represent fertility, grace, and courage. In others, like the Cherokee, they are symbols of loyalty and friendship. In some Native American tribes, deer are seen as bringers of luck and harbingers of good fortune.",
        "Encounter Odds Percentage": "30%",
        "Also Known By": "Cervids, Ungulates, Bambi",
        "Physical Features": "Deer typically have long, thin legs with two-toed hooves, small heads with large ears, and long bodies with thick fur coats. Depending on the species, their color ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-white. Males often possess branching antlers, usually shed and regrown each season.",
        "Location Found": "Deer are found in many habitats, from the arid deserts to the cold mountains and the lush forests. They can be found in many places in the world, ranging from North America, Europe, and Asia to Africa and Australia.",
        "Sleeps": "Most deer sleep during the day, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures and the cover of shadows. They will also rest during the hottest periods of the day, usually near a food source in order to conserve energy.",
        "Active During": "Most deer are active during the hours of dawn and dusk, when they feed heavily, and during the late night and early morning, when the grass is usually dry and more easily accessed.",
        "Role In Ecosystem": "Deer are a keystone species in many environments. Their grazing helps to maintain a delicate balance of resources, spreading the grass and foliage for other species to feed on, and also helping protect the land from over-grazing. Deer also contribute to greater biodiversity in the area due to their migratory tendencies.",
        "Environmental Factors": "Deer are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, with overgrazing or destruction of their habitat leading to population declines. They are also sensitive to particular types of pollution such as vehicle exhaust or oil spills, which can directly affect their food source. If environmental conditions become too harsh, deer may migrate to areas with better conditions.",
        "Habits": "Deer are normally social animals, living in small groups with complex hierarchical structures. They may sometimes form large herds, often migrating across large distances in search of food or in response to changes in their environment. They are generally herbivores, and prefer fresh, new growth for their food.",
        "Behavior": "Deer are a timid and gentle species, and generally prefer to avoid conflict. They will often flee from perceived threats, and if cornered or sufficiently threatened, will defend themselves with their antlers, hooves, and teeth. They can also exhibit a pattern of flight and fight, in which they will be spooked and then stand their ground.",
        "Cultural Significance": "Deer have long been held as sacred animals in many cultures, where they are seen as symbols of grace, courage, and fertility. Historically, they have been objects of veneration, hunted for food, and even domesticated and tended by humans in order to provide sustenance. Today, they still play an important role in many cultures.",

Deer are also not responsible for large amounts of deforestation, as they are mainly grazers, not browsers. Finally, deer are not averse to human contact and can be tamed if raised from infancy.",
        "Stereotypes": "Deer are often seen as docile, timid creatures without a care for their own safety. This isn't always the case, as deer can be quite intelligent and learn to recognize threats and respond accordingly.",

        "Narrative": "In a dark, forgotten corner of the world, a god of chaos and evil began to meddle in the affairs of the drow, a sinister race of dark elves living far below the surface. In a desperate attempt to please their patron, the drow summoned demons and bound them to the bodies of spider hybrids, creating the terrible monsters known as driders. Driven by their insatiable lust for conquest, driders continuously search for new ways to expand their influence and please their god.",
        "Background": "Driders are the horrible result of drow experiments with powerful dark magic. Long ago, a god of chaos and evil granted the drow a boon in exchange for their loyalty: the creation of driders. The drow pushed the boundaries of dark magic, binding powerful demons to unsuspecting victims, weaving the two together in a grotesque experiment that resulted in a creature that could walk upright on two legs, and yet still crawl along walls like a spider. These creatures have become servants of the drow, but they are also feared by all who come across them, including their masters.",

While the drow are still their primary masters, driders will also serve other dark gods and powerful beings, spreading their evil far beyond their homes in the Underdark.",

Those who come across driders quickly learn to fear them, for these aberrant creatures are as cunning and devious in their actions as they are terrifying in their visage. Most people who venture into the darkness of the Underdark dread the chance of encountering a drider, and for good reason; these sinister creatures are more than capable of using their dark powers and monstrous strength to bring ruin to the unwary.",

        "Description": "A giant bat is a monstrous creature that resembles a bat, but is much larger with a wingspan of up to four feet",
        "Narrative": "Giant bats are a mysterious and rare sight, even in the darkest corners of the world. Most people living away from civilization never encounter them, and those that have often strain their memories to confirm what they have seen. Giant bats appear as a large bat, with a wingspan up to four feet, leathery skin, and a large, humanoid-like head. They tend to live in the darkest of caves, most commonly hunting in the deep night, swooping down swiftly to snatch up any unsuspecting creatures. Some tales tell of giant bats that wander the night in search of more than their natural prey, brazen and fearless as to the consequences.",
        "Background": "Giant bats, known to some as 'nightmares' or 'dread wings', are old and mysterious creatures, shrouded in tales and legends. Many tales speak of their ferocity, and an unnerving ability to find their prey no matter where it is--whether by smell, sound, or some other mysterious means. These tales have earned giant bats a reputation as giant predators, fearless hunters who seek out the weak and the vulnerable in search of nourishment. But this is far from the truth; giant bats are peaceful creatures, largely content to leave all but the most reckless of adventurers be, their cries resonating with a strange and alien beauty.",
        "History": "Giant bats have existed for hundreds of years, the stories of them spanning back through ancient texts and folk lore tales. They are said to have once migrated in great flocks through the night sky of the old-world, as if guided by some unseen force. Today, giant bats are far rarer, with their populations having dwindled drastically over the centuries. Few know the true cause of their extinction, though some blame the destruction of ancient woodlands and the poor air quality across many cities.",
        "Lore": "Lore suggests that giant bats were once one of the noblest of creatures, flying in large flocks at night and even aiding lost travellers. However, this is likely just a story, as it does not match the behaviour of the giant bats of today. Some sages also claim these creatures have an understanding of the magical realms, with some theorising that their cries are the key to unlocking the mysteries of the arcane.",

Its mottled skin is perfect camouflage when lurking in the water, and when seen atop a log, its size intimidates even the strongest of adversaries.

They are excellent camouflage hunters, able to blend in with their surroundings and ambush unsuspecting victims.",
        "History": "Giant frogs are thought to have first appeared in 6th century Europe, where they were believed to be magical creatures capable of granting wishes or predicting the future. In newer times, they are often encountered by adventurers traveling in swamp and marshlands. Tales of their size and power have become almost legendary, leading to many superstitions about them that are still held by some.",

Additionally, they have powerful tails that end in a sharp point that they use in fighting.",
        "Location Found": "Giant sea horses are mainly found in oceans across the D&D multiverse, usually near the coasts.

        "Misconceptions": "Many confuse giant sea horses with their smaller cousins, the regular sea horses. This is understandable, as they are visually quite similar. However, giant sea horses are much larger, much more powerful, and possess far greater magical abilities than regular sea horses.",

Additionally, they will usually shy away from other large predators, including dragon turtles, giant sharks, and whales.",

Theories range from them being a natural byproduct of an ancient pollution to them being an incredibly ancient species that has evolved over the eons to adapt to whatever environment they find themselves in. Whatever the truth may be, it is unquestionable that the gray ooze has become a powerful force in many ecosystems, beloved by some and feared by others.",
        "Lore": "The gray ooze has long been a source of fear and confusion among the people of Faerun.

The long, sleek bodies of these vicious beasts swim the deep waters, patrolling the depths for any hapless creature that catches their attention.",

The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter. When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

They hunt in groups, have highly-developed communication systems and are known to mate for life.",
        "History": "Killer whales have a long and interesting history. They have been around for millions of years, but were not given their scientific name, Orcinus orca, until 1758. They have been the staple of seafaring cultures and mythologies around the world, from the throat-singing of the Inuit of the Arctic to the sea-stories of the West Coast of Japan. The scientific name for killer whales is derived from Orcus, a Roman god of the underworld and the ruler of the deep.",
        "Lore": "Killer whales have been venerated by, and revered for, their power and grace in many cultures and mythologies. In ancient Babylon, Oannes was believed to be a half-fish, half-human entity who emerged from the sea and taught humans the arts and sciences.

        "Behavior": "Killer whales are highly intelligent and social animals that travel in pods, with some organizations estimated to have between 5 and 40 individuals. They are a matriarchal species, typically led by the eldest female in the pod. The rest of the pod follows and works together to target prey and defend the group from predators like sharks. They are curious and playful animals, engaging in a variety of activities from breaching and tail-slapping to chasing one another.",

        "Group Dynamics": "Killer whaless live in pods that can be made up of anything from extended family groups to large collections of visiting killer whales. In pods, the elder females are usually the leader and will communicate with the other members of the pod via various sound cues.

Standing at only two to three feet tall, they prefer to remain out of the way, mostly keeping to themselves and rarely involving themselves in the affairs of other races.

To a kobold, traps are an art form, and provide a sense of satisfaction in the form of a challenge that must be overcome by an intruder.  They also have an affinity for digging and burrowing, as well as an impressive knack for engineering, allowing them to amass impressive murals, networks of tunnels and lairs, and other such traps and challenges.",

While they may lack the physical prowess of larger creatures, kobolds often employ traps and tricks to ward off intruders. In addition, they often work together in small groups to outwit or overpower larger enemies. Above all else, kobolds prize loyalty and cunning, priding themselves on their ability to survive in almost any environment.",

They come in a variety of colors, sizes, and shapes, though they all share similar characteristics like four legs, a scaly hide, and a long tail.

In Chinese mythology, lizards represent good fortune, while lizards in Greek mythology are believed to be harbingers of death. In some cultures, lizards are also seen as symbols of strength and durability.",
        "History": "Lizards have been around since the Triassic period, about 200 million years ago. Since then, they have adapted to survive in almost any climate, from deserts to rainforests.

        "Tactics Within A Group": "The same defensive behavior can be observed when lizards are in small groups, however, they are more likely to rely on the added strength offered by a group when facing a threat. Some species, such as brush lizards, can utilize tree climbing as a defensive tactic.",

These reptilian people are proud of their accomplishments, but always looking to the future.",
        "Background": "Lizardfolk have been around since the beginning of time, living in remote locations, deep in the forests, or on the edges of swamps.

They are a hardy and tenacious race, formidable hunters and expert adventurers.",
        "History": "Long ago, lizardfolk were dominant species, living in the ancient cities near the seas. They built great empires, and sailed the world in search of new lands and treasures. Eventually, as human civilizations began to rise, the lizardfolk found that their empires were gradually shrinking. Despite their best efforts, their numbers dwindled and their influence in the world waned. Although their once great empires are now all but forgotten, there are still enclaves of lizardfolk who cling to their traditions, and continue to carry on the fight to protect their ancient heritage.",
        "Lore": "It is said that lizardfolk are a primitive race that broke away from their ancient ancestors and evolved a primitive but effective tribal culture. They have close ties to nature, and many believe that they can speak to and understand the primal spirits of the land. Some lizardfolk can even call upon strange and powerful forces to aid them in their endeavors. Despite their primitive nature, they are incredibly intelligent, and their craftsmen are renowned for the fine weapons and tools that they can produce.",

        "Description": "Merrows are fierce aquatic creatures that resemble large, humanoid, folk with fish-like features. They have a long, flat face with large, bulging eyes, small nostrils, and razor-sharp teeth. Their bodies are covered with slimy blue-green scales, and their hands and feet are webbed, granting them enhanced swimming speed. Their fins are strong enough to lighten their underwater maneuvers, allowing them to glide quickly through the depths.",
        "Narrative": "The merrow are a race of fearsome aquatic creatures that lurk in the depths of swamps, rivers, and oceans, making their homes where the water is deep and the darkness is unending. They are malicious adversaries to any unsuspecting travelers who dare journey into their depths, attacking with sharp claws, razor-like teeth, and a hunger for human flesh.

        "Lore": "Merrows are said to be the cousins of sea hags, though many experts dispute this claim. They have a reputation for being vengeful assassins who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Merrows are also believed to be able to shapeshift into human form, allowing them to move amongst us undetected. In some stories, they are said to have a taste for human flesh, and will mercilessly hunt and kill any unfortunate soul who gets in their way.",

Though much of Grorrtskai has been lost to time, it is said that orcs ruled over a great stretch of land that spanned from the realms now known as Tethyn and lorresh to even farther east.

They are the largest land predators on earth, and can grow to be up to 13 feet tall. They have a keen sense of smell and hearing, and they are powerful swimmers. They feed mainly on fish and other marine life found in the arctic, and while they don't always go after people, they are capable of attacks if they feel threatened or hungry.",
        "History": "The polar bear is an ancient species that has been around for over two million years. They have been an important part of the Arctic ecosystem for centuries. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were hunted by indigenous people, as well as early explorers and whalers, for their fur and other body parts. This over-hunting caused a drastic decline in the polar bear population, and it wasn't until the 1970s that their population began to recover, thanks to conservation efforts.",
        "Lore": "The polar bear is a powerful and mysterious creature in Arctic folklore. In Inuit lore, the polar bear is a symbol of strength and power, and is seen as a protector of the land and its inhabitants. It has the power to inhabit both the physical and spiritual worlds, and is seen as a messenger between the two. The polar bear is also seen as a symbol of courage, and is a symbol of good luck. Some Inuit hunters will wear a polar bear pelt for luck on a hunt. In Norse mythology, the polar bear is seen as a fierce and dangerous creature.",

        "Role In Ecosystem": "Polar bears are predators at the top of the Arctic food chain. They are an important part of the Arctic ecosystem and help keep its balance in check. They also help maintain the health of the marine environment by helping remove weak, sick, or injured fish and marine mammals.",
        "Environmental Factors": "The polar bear is a cold weather species, and due to its dependence on the Arctic ice cover, its population can be sensitive to changes in climate. They are also affected by human activity, such as oil and gas drilling and other forms of environmental pollution.",

        "Behavior": "Polar bears are normally solitary animals, but they can exhibit cooperative behavior when hunting. They are quite protective of their home range, and when threatened, they are known to charge, and can be quite aggressive. They also have a unique defensive adaptation of using the same scent to mask their presence in the Arctic.",
        "Cultural Significance": "The polar bear has been an important part of Arctic culture and folklore for centuries. For the Inuit, the polar bear is seen as a powerful being, and it is seen as a source of food, clothing, and spiritual guidance.

        "Description": "Quippers are predatory fish found living in underground pools beneath various grimy settlements. They are related to ordinary piranhas and range in size from 4 to 12 inches long. Quippers are distinguished by their sharp spines and an insidious, predatory behavior.",
        "Narrative": "Quippers are small aquatic predators that inhabit the murky waters of underground caves and dilapidated mines. They rarely venture to the surface, preferring to leave the confines of their underground homes when desperate for food. Quippers hunt in swarms and can quickly overwhelm their prey in a deadly feeding frenzy. Despite their diminutive size, these predators are both dangerous and highly adaptive.",
        "Background": "Quippers are a semi-intelligent species of fish that inhabit the dark underground rivers and caves of the land. They evolved in these remote subterranean environments to adapt to their difficult life within the shadows. Quippers have sharp spines along their backs and possess vicious, predatory behavior. While they can survive in harsh surface conditions for short periods of time, Quippers feel most comfortable in the dark, humid depths of their underground domain.",
        "History": "Quippers are a species of fish that have been around for centuries. They were first documented in the ancient dwarven texts of the Lost Realm of Caldera and have since spread across the world.

For entertainment, a few gladiatorial arenas use Quippers in their tournaments while warring factions have been known to use them to swarm the battlefield.",
        "Lore": "Quippers are fierce hunters with a voracious appetite for blood. They are fiercely territorial and keenly aware of their surroundings. It is said that they possess an echolocation sense that they use to detect drones, cave fish, and other unsuspecting creatures in its vicinity.

        "Habits": "Quippers are mostly solitary predators, but they can become aggressive when in groups and hunt in swarms. They tend to remain in small groups, and hunt by group coordination. Furthermore, Quippers can move astonishingly fast and achieve impressive jumps - it's even said that some can jump up to 6 feet in the air.",
        "Behavior": "Quippers are curious and intelligent creatures. They can become aggressive if provoked, and they also have a keen awareness of their surroundings. They will often swim away if they sense an intruder, but they can become agitated and attack if they feel threatened.",

Since then, raiding parties have been formed to protect the innocent from the effectively indestructible menace.",

        "Background": "Specters are thought to be the spirits of those who have died under unpleasant circumstances, or who were particularly devoted to a cause in life. Many scholars have theorized that Specters are actually incorporeal wraiths that have been partially bound to the physical realm by powerful necromantic magics. It is believed that Specters are bound to a particular location, and are able to interact with the physical realm in ways that other incorporeal creatures are unable to.",
        "History": "The existence of Specters is believed to have been discovered by the ancient civilization of Tirolo. This ancient people believed that ghosts and undead creatures of all kinds were tied to the otherwise unseen forces that governed the land. In their rituals and ceremonies, they largely worshiped the forces of death, believing that by doing so they could protect themselves from the malevolent entities that may have been around them. It is unclear whether this belief predates the discovery of the Specters.",
        "Lore": "In ancient cultures, Specters were seen as omens of death, and it was said that those who encountered them were doomed to an early demise. Some cultures believed that the presence of a Specter was actually a sign of divine intervention, and that the cursed person would soon be blessed with a divine boon. The traditions vary depending upon the region, though most people still believe that a Specter often marks the end of a particular life.",

        "Description": "Spiders are eight-legged arthropods with two body parts, known as cephalothorax and abdomen. Most spiders have eight eyes, although there are some subgroups within the order Araneae which have fewer. Spiders vary in size from less than 0.1 inches (2.5 mi) to more than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.",
        "Narrative": "In the dark of night, a spider silently crawls along the shadows, looking for its prey. It skitters across it's web, weaving intricate patterns in its path. When it finally finds an unsuspecting bug, it pounces, trapping it in its web and slowly devouring it. Spiders are swift and efficient predators, demonstrated by their tricky webs and powerful venom.",
        "Background": "Spiders are found on all continents in the world, except Antarctica, and have been around since at least 400 million years. They are found in almost every terrestrial habitat, and some even live in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. They range in size, diet, and behavior, making them incredibly diverse. Some spiders spin webs to catch their prey, others hunt on the ground. Regardless of their lifestyle, spiders are an incredibly successful and evolutionary successful creature.",
        "History": "Spiders have been around since before the dinosaurs and have maintained a fossil record since then. They were thought to have originated in the Carboniferous era, which dates back to between 360 and 299 million years ago. They were thought to be found mostly in tropical and subtropical climates, with their range gradually expanding during the Cretaceous period, which occurred between 145 and 66 million years ago.",
        "Lore": "In mythology, spiders often have negative connotations, such as with the spider-like monster in Greek mythology, the Arachne, or the Eight-legged Horse of Odin in Norse myths. These creatures typically have malicious intent or weave webs and lairs that ensnare unsuspecting prey. Throughout history, spiders have been seen as both sinister and helpful creatures, weaving webs to trap and catch food for the hunter, and in some cases, even defending against larger predators.",
        "Encounter Odds Percentage": "75%",
        "Also Known By": "spider, arachnid, cobweb spider, tarantula",
        "Physical Features": "Spiders range in size from 1mm to more than 9cm in their body length. Depending on the species, they may be gray, brown, green, black, white, or even multicolored. Most spiders have eight eyes, although some species possess fewer. Spiders often have long, thin legs, and may also have hairs, bumps, and spinnerets. Their exoskeletons are hard and shiny, and may be covered in colorful fur or other material.",
        "Location Found": "Spiders can be found almost anywhere in the world, on all continents except Antarctica. Many species prefer specific climates or environments, such as deserts, forests, wetlands, and shrublands. They can be found in almost any terrestrial habitat, and over 40 percent of all spiders live in close proximity to water.",
        "Sleeps": "Spiders are nocturnal creatures and many rely on their eyesight to hunt prey. This means they tend to be most active during the night when they can creep around without being seen.",
        "Active During": "Night",
        "Role In Ecosystem": "Spiders play an important role in the environment by keeping insect and pest populations in check. They are often the top predators of their habitat and as such, help keep the balance of the food web. They also play a role by feeding on decomposing and decaying matter, helping to break down and clean up the environment.",
        "Environmental Factors": "Spiders are highly sensitive to changes in light, temperature, humidity, and air pressure. This means they can be affected by severe weather changes and environmental factors such as air pollution, drought, and floods.",
        "Habits": "Most spiders are predatory and feed on insects and other arthropods. Spiders build webs or hunt actively depending on the species. Web-building spiders usually build intricate webs of silk, which they use to capture their prey. Other spiders are active hunters and use their eyesight and sense of smell to find prey.",
        "Behavior": "Spiders are loners and prefer to live alone. They may come together in large groups during a mating season, when the males will compete for the females. In most cases, they will immediately separate after mating. Some spiders may stay in the same area year-round, while others may migrate to different areas during the year.",
        "Cultural Significance": "The spider has been used in many cultures as a symbol of protection and luck. In some cultures, spiders are seen as positive symbols and associated with wisdom, creativity, and patience. In others, they are seen as a sign of evil and bad luck.

        "Commonly Mistake For": "Ticks, mites, and scorpions.",
        "Tactics If Alone": "Spiders are solitary predators and use a combination of vision, touch, and smell to locate their prey. They often build webs made of strands of silk, which they use to trap their prey. Some species of spider are ambush predators, and may lurk in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to strike.",
        "Tactics Within A Group": "Spiders rarely move in groups, as they are solitary creatures. However, when mating season arrives large numbers of spiders may be seen in the same place. During these times the males will compete for the attention of the females.",
        "Group Dynamics": "Spiders are loners and rarely congregate in large numbers. For the most part, they are independent creatures, hunting and living alone.",
        "Avoids": "Most spiders will avoid bright lights, loud noises, and strong odors, as these can be disorienting and can also draw unwanted attention from predators. For the most part, spiders are also afraid of fire and will avoid it.",
        "Targets": "Spiders usually target insects and other small prey. They can also target humans if they feel threatened, though bites from a spider rarely cause serious damage.",

        "Narrative": "Stirges were once the scavengers of the animal world. Much like the vultures of the land, they sought out easy-to-find food sources and fought off competition viciously. But as the world changed, the Stirge found itself without a niche in the ever-changing ecosystem.

They often feed on the life-force of their victims, draining their victims of all their energy and leaving them dead or near death. Stirges are cowardly creatures, flittering away when confronted by larger threats.",

This vicious group of small, ravenous fish inhabit many waterways across the land, and they will swarm any unsuspecting individual foolish enough to enter their domain. Hunted and harassed, they hunt in packs and will stop at nothing to get to their target.",
        "Background": "Quippers originated from the depths of an unnamed sea. They then spread across many waterways, creating their own unique presence. Although all quippers are viciously aggressive, some are known to be more alert and powerful than others - these are the so-called swarms of quippers. They feed in large swarms, their innumerable eyes scanning the waters for a suitable meal. Although they will eat almost anything, they are especially fond of human flesh.",
        "History": "The exact origin of quippers is unknown, though it's likely they were originally a large oceanic species. They eventually spread into smaller bodies of water, and eventually became a nuisance in many lakes, rivers, and streams.

Some fishermen even cultivate them for their sheer viciousness, harvesting them to be used in war or as weapons.",
        "Lore": "Quippers have been seen as an ill omen by some cultures, believed to be a sign of either plague or death.

        "Habits": "Quippers travel in groups or swarms. When a potential meal is identified, the swarm will surround and attack it in a feeding frenzy. They are also highly aggressive and territorial, so they tend to attack anything or anyone that enters their territory.",
        "Behavior": "Quippers are highly aggressive and will attack anything that they perceive as a threat. They will even attack each other in a feeding frenzy if food is scarce. They are also known to attack boats and ships, often ramming them with their razor sharp beaks.",

        "Description": "Triceratops is a powerful and large bipedal dinosaur with a huge head topped with three horns and a bony frill about its neck. It has a long, heavy tail and walks on thick, column-like legs. Its horns and frill make it a formidable opponent to those who might threaten it.",
        "Narrative": "For millennias the triceratops has roamed the land, its powerful frame and size kept sustained by their tough hide and constant search for food. These large beasts are considered lone hunters and are rarely seen in groups. Although their stature is intimidating, their lone attitude makes it difficult to capture one for a pet or mount. However, some have noble hearts and can serve as powerful guardians to those who are able to tame them.",
        "Background": "Triceratops is an herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the late Cretaceous period. While the largest estimates place it at around the size of an African elephant, recent finds suggest its size may have been smaller. Its horns and frill made it a fearsome predator, capable of taking on large carnivores such as the T-Rex. Its name means \u201cthree horns on the face,\u201d referring to its two brow horns and the nasal horn on its nose.",
        "History": "Triceratops fossils are some of the most common dinosaur remains found throughout North America. Its bones have been found in places such as Colorado, Montana and Wyoming.

        "History": "Troglodytes were first spotted in the underground tunnels of the Sword Coast, the forge site of the first dwarven kingdom. Many speculate that these primitive creatures evolved from a combination of reptilian and humanoid beings that were left behind in the First Age by the powerful avatars of the Gods. Later, they were seen in far-off empires like Calimshan, and were thought of as a myth by most until their discovery in other underground sanctums.",

Veterans do not always fight in the same manner either, as they can opt for more direct conflict or ambushes depending on the situation.",

        "Stereotypes": "Veterans are often stereotyped as mercenaries, raiders or brigands.

        "Commonly Mistake For": "Veterans are sometimes mistaken for lesser fighters or mercenaries.

They are also known to use guile and subterfuge to catch their foe off-guard.",
        "Tactics Within A Group": "Veterans usually fight in organized formations within a group, leading their troops or commanding squads.

They also know how to work together, as they have experience dealing with larger battles and enemies.",

        "Description": "Tieflings are a race of humanoid fiendish creatures, usually described as having an appearance mixing features of human and fiend (such as horns, pointed teeth, and other demonic features)",
        "Narrative": "Tieflings are a mysterious race of humanoid fiends, deriving from the time of the Blood War when powerful beings made pacts with demons or devils. Rumors and legends of Tieflings being creatures cursed with an unholy origin, bearing the features of their demonic parent or being of a special bloodline have followed them for centuries. It is said that Tieflings are driven by a single urge that cannot be denied: to use the power from their fiendish ancestry to achieve their own often selfish and chaotic goals. They are often viewed with distrust and suspicion, as it is believed that Tieflings cannot control the evil within their blood.",
        "Background": "The origins of the Tiefling race are shrouded in mystery and darkness. They are descended from humans who made powerful pacts with powerful fiends or demon lords, usually to gain power or knowledge. It is not known how many generations of Tieflings have been born since these original pacts were made, though they have spread across the world and are now found in every major city. For centuries, Tieflings have been persecuted and mistreated, seen as half-human, half-demonic creatures. Despite this, they have been able to survive and thrive alongside other races, due to their strength, cunning, and determination.",
        "History": "In ancient times, when gods and mortals were still one and the same, some humans made pacts with fiends and gained powerful magic in return. These humans, and their descendants, gained fiendish features and traits such as horns, fangs, and a forked tongue. These humans, known as Tieflings, were despised and feared by the majority of the population. Over the centuries, their reputation grew; tales of their dark deeds, vengeful natures, and supernatural powers becoming increasingly common. It wasn't until the Age of War, when the gods shifted away from human form, that the Tieflings faded into the shadows of forgotten history.",
        "Lore": "The most pervasive myth about Tieflings is that they are cursed by their fiendish parentage. It is said that no matter how hard they try, they will always be drawn to the darker side of their nature and viciousness will come more naturally to them than restraint and mercy. In actuality, while many Tieflings may be fiercely independent and single-minded in pursuit of their goals, each one's nature is determined by their upbringing and their choices.",

Their skin is mostly soft and leathery, though there are small spikes in some places, and they have short vines that grow out of their heads. Most have four to six eyes, but some have more, and these eyes usually come in yellow, orange, or red. Myconids speak their own language, as well as Druidic, and their voices are fungal chimes or a light whistling.",
        "Narrative": "Myconids are an ancient species of fungus-like humanoids. They were believed to have evolved from subterranean fungal colonies that eventually developed independent mobility.

Despite this, there have been several encounters between these mysterious creatures and adventurers or explorers.",
        "Background": "Myconids have long been seen as a symbol of mystery among many races. Reclusive and deeply rooted in the secrets of the wild, these sentient fungi live in small colonies deep in the underdark.

That being said, myconids can be incredibly friendly and are said to be quite welcoming to visitors in their home. The relationship between myconids and their environment is one of immense respect, where they do all they can to preserve the wildlife that surrounds them.",
        "History": "Myconids have been around since the dawn of time, believed to have sprouted from the sacred ground of ancient forests. It is said that the first myconid was born from the spore of a great and powerful fungus, the \u201cFather of Spores,\u201d and that all other myconids descended from him. Myconids have lived in relative obscurity since their creation, but they have recently been thrust into the spotlight due to increased contact with other races.",
        "Lore": "Myconids are the most mysterious of creatures. They are reclusive and rarely seen, living deep within dark and often forgotten corners of the world. The few that have been encountered exude a sense of great wisdom, though much of their existence remains shrouded in mystery.
